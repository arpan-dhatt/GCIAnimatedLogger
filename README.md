# GCIAnimatedLogger
This is for the task "Add a callback to use an animated progress bar in tf.keras" for GCI Tensorflow.

It uses the ProgbarLogger from the official Tensorflow libarary as a foundation. However, it will support more incremental progress bar size and a more elegant way to display metrics (WIP).
