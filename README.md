# GCIAnimatedLogger
This is for the task "Add a callback to use an animated progress bar in tf.keras" for GCI Tensorflow.

It uses the ProgbarLogger from the official Tensorflow libarary as a foundation. It generates small sparkline-esque graphs to make it easier to view the progress of different metrics at the end of each epoch.
